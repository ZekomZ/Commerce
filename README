Commerce?
====================
...imports Commerce entities (e.g. products) using Feeds.

Installation
============

- Install & enable the Feeds (including UI) Commerce modules (including product, price and their UI modules), Commerce Feeds and Commerce Features module
- Go to admin/structure/feeds and add a new importer
- Select the "Commerce Product processor"
- In Settings, select a product type to use to create new product entities
- In Mapping, select how raw input fields map on fields of the product entity. Select at least Product SKU (make unique) and Product Title.


Example configuration and feature
=================================

The commerce_feeds_example feature is included to quickly show 
- how a comma-separated file can be used to import product entities. These are effictively releases from Discogs API
- how the same comma-separated file can be used to import product display nodes linking to product entities via their SKU. The nodes are equivalent to main release in Dispcogs API 

1. Import product entities.
- Install the feature module "commerce_feeds_example"
- Go to /import and click 'Product importer'
- Enter a release url  (e.g. examples at Discogs 2.0 help page "http://www.discogs.com/help/api")  in "URL" textfield. Hit import button
- Go to /admin/commerce/products to see the imported products

2. Import product display nodes.
Repeat the same steps but chose 'Product reference importer' and select the same 
URL'.

TODO
====
- Documentation on architecture
- Add "product field" to "main release" node (in function discogs_commerce_field_default_fields)
- "main release" node should have form / add to cart button on install
- Improve UI (alllow logical search terms e,g, name of artist, then wrap in "url request" request before sending request)
- Feeds fetcher module needs testing / improvements
- Import search api requests (example at Discogs 2.0 help page) 
- Mapper to import data for field holding multiple items. Investigate functionality of - Add choice of XMLpath parser. 
- Importer for Artists or Labels as node with releases as probuct.
